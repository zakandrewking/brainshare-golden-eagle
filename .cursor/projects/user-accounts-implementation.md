# User Accounts Implementation Project Plan

## Project Overview
Implement a complete user authentication and account management system for the Brainshare application to enable user-specific features, document ownership, and enhanced security.

## Current State Analysis
- Next.js application with live collaborative tables
- Liveblocks integration for real-time collaboration
- No existing authentication system
- Database schema exists but no user tables
- Document sharing without user context

## Goals
- [ ] Secure user registration and authentication
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Document ownership and permissions
- [ ] Integration with existing Liveblocks collaboration
- [ ] User-specific document access controls

## Technical Stack Decisions
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)
- **Database**: Extend existing database with user tables
- **Password Security**: bcrypt for hashing
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with secure cookies
- **Email Verification**: Optional but recommended

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
### 1.1 Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Create `users` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `email` (unique, not null)
  - `password_hash` (not null)
  - `name` (not null)
  - `avatar_url` (nullable)
  - `email_verified` (boolean, default false)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)
- [ ] Create `user_sessions` table for session management
- [ ] Create `documents` table linking to users:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `title` (not null)
  - `description` (nullable)
  - `owner_id` (foreign key to users)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)
- [ ] Create `document_permissions` table for sharing:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `document_id` (foreign key)
  - `user_id` (foreign key)
  - `permission_level` (enum: 'read', 'write', 'admin')
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

### 1.2 Authentication Setup

### 4.3 Liveblocks Integration
- [ ] Update Liveblocks room configuration with user context
- [ ] Pass authenticated user info to collaboration components

- Plan for data migration of existing documents

### Liveblocks Integration
- Update room authentication to use real user IDs
- Ensure proper user context in collaborative features
- Handle anonymous vs authenticated user scenarios

### Security Best Practices
- Use HTTPS everywhere

- Regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can register and login securely
- [ ] Documents are properly associated with owners
- [ ] Sharing functionality works correctly
- [ ] Real-time collaboration shows actual user identities
- [ ] All security requirements are met
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] User experience is intuitive and smooth
