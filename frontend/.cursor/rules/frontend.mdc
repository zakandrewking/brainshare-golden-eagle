- NEVER EVER add comments to code. The only exceptions are you can add a docstring
  to a function or module, or you can add a couple sentences describing a
  complex design decision. Otherwise, NO COMMENTS.
- never use a check like process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" to get around failing tests
- ALWAYS run tests using the shell tool after implementing them or making edits
  to them. Be clever about running the tests at useful times to get info about
  how work is progressing. We're not done until all the tests are passing.
- if error info needs to be returned to the calling function, just throw an
  appropriate error. do not return an object with error info
- ALWAYS use frontend components from /components/ui when possible
- ALWAYS use lucide-react for icons if possible
- use server actions instead of api routes in next.js
- for toast messages, call sonner directly
- create and modify sql schemas in /db/schema. Do not edit
  `/supabase/migrations/` -- this is autogenerated
