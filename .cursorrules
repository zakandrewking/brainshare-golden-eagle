- NEVER EVER add comments to code. The only exceptions are you can add a docstring
  to a function or module, or you can add a couple sentences describing a
  complex design decision. Otherwise, NO COMMENTS.
- always use frontend components from /components/ui when possible
- always use lucide-react for icons if possible
- use server actions instead of api routes in next.js
- for toast messages, call sonner directly
- create and modify sql schemas in /db/schema. Do not edit
  `/supabase/migrations/` -- this is autogenerated
